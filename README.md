# litepqxx
Litepqxx is (planned to be) a wrapper library to access SQLite3 via API compatible with Libpqxx

## Usecases
* For quick prototyping with SQLite3 and smooth migration to Postgresql.
* To use SQLite3 as a stub when you test your project with Postgresql.
or
* Just as a better, object-oriented API for SQLite3.
